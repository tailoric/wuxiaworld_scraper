A quick Python scraper for wuxiaworld.com using Requests & BeautifulSoup.
Unlike the EPUBs floating around, the ones that come out of here have correct
chapter breaks and hyperlinked table of contents.

**NOTE**: The translator(s) at wuxiaworld.com wish to keep the community
centralized, so please do not post the resulting epubs to the public. They
don't mind if we make our own epubs, which is why I have written this scraper.
So feel free to make and use your own, but please respect their wishes
on this matter.

Even better, go participate in the community and let the translator know how
much you appreciate his work!

Only tested on Linux for now.
Creates separate HTML and optionally EPUBs for each "Book."

Here is what argparse tells me the usage is:

```
    $ ./wuxiaworld_scraper.py -h
    usage: wuxiaworld_scraper.py [-h] [--delay DELAY] [--books BOOKS [BOOKS ...]]
                                 [--no-epub] [-v]
                                 url

    Wuxiaworld Scraper

    positional arguments:
      url                   Index page of story to scrape

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --delay DELAY         Delay between scraping chapters (don't wanna get
                            banned!)
      --books BOOKS [BOOKS ...]
                            The books to download (defaults to all)
      --no-epub             Automatically run pandoc to convert to epub. (Requires
                            pandoc on path)
      -v, --verbose         Adds debugging statements to output

```

DELAY is the pause between chapter downloads so we don't make a ton of requests
very fast, which could get us banned. By default, the script waits one second
between chapter downloads. It could be way faster if the books downloaded in
parallel, but don't do that. I haven't gotten banned yet with all my testing...

Passing the verbose flag will give you some feedback in case the default
behavior doesn't seem to be working or if you want to tinker with the code.

Here are some ways to run it:

Download all of Coiling Dragon and create EPUBS:

```
./wuxiaworld_scraper.py http://www.wuxiaworld.com/cdindex-html
```

Download book 3 of Coiling Dragon, but don't make an EPUB:

```
./wuxiaworld_scraper.py --no-epub http://www.wuxiaworld.com/cdindex-html --books 3
```

Download books 5-7 of Stellar Transformations and make EPUBs:

```
./wuxiaworld_scraper.py http://www.wuxiaworld.com/st-index --books 5 6 7
```
